<ul>
<li> Handle devices with small width, but no touch events.
<li> Use a list-structure on the tabs instead of divs or spans or whatever I use now.
<li> Make it as a jQuery plugin? Or:
<li> Make it independent of libraries? (One of these must be done before I call it "Version 1.0.0")
<li> Easier for end-users to thematize their tabs (how?)
</ul>
