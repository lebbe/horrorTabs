<ul>
<li> Make this compatible with jQuery UI Tabs
<li> Handle devices with small width, but no touch events.
<li> Use a list-structure on the tabs instead of divs or spans or whatever I use now.
<li> Make it as a jQuery plugin? Or:
<li> Make it independent of libraries? (One of these must be done before I call it "Version 1.0.0")
<li> Easier for end-users to thematize their tabs (how?)
<li> Check if there is a scrollbar, if it is, show right arrow
<li> Investigate whether the tab-structure are optimal for visually impaired users.
<li> Investigate whether the tab-structure degrades gracaefully for non-javascript browsers (for non-visually impaired users)
</ul>
