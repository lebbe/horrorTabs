horrorTabs v 0.0.1
==========

Horizontal scrollable tab-section for handheld devices, great for responsive web-sites.
Convert your horizontal menu to a touch-friendly sliding panel when horizontal space is
sparse, instead of clogging up the screen with a menu before representing content to the
user.



Setup
=====

<ol>
<li> Download horrorScroll.js and style/style.css.
<li> Include these files in the head of your .html file.
<li> Include jQuery (or similar libraries with jQuery syntax, let me know if it won't work) :-)
<li> For now, view the html in the demo-file.
</ol>

I am not done with "Version 1.0.0" yet. Use at own risk, etc, and please feel free to come with feedback.
